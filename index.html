      #DevOps-ing the Hard Way.

      ##A non recipe.
      ???
      That presentation is:

      * Not a off-the-shelf solution for DevOps
      * Not a demonstration of a powerful DevOps tool
      * Some feedback about my 3 years DevOps experience
      * My humble opinion on what DevOps is supposed to be
      * Advices on how to get started while working with different kind of people
      * A reminder that DevOps is a human transformation before everything.

      ???
      * That presentation contains a bit of sarcasm
      * No offense ;) Just exagerating a bit on some contexts to deliver easily my message ;)
      ---
      ![](img/nothing.gif)
      ???
      * All contexts, teams and projects are different... So I clearly don't pretend I know everything
      * By the way, nobody should ;)
      ---
      ![](img/truth.gif)
      ???
      * My humble opinion: there is no truth about DevOps anyway...
      * Except maybe the fact that it won't be the same for all the teams ;)

      ![](img/team.jpg)
      ???
      * After working hard during 3/4 years, we managed a DevOps transition in our team!
      * It didn't go without failing... We actually failed a lot!
      * But in the end: we delivered our projects, and we became so much more efficient!
      * One metric? We went from 1 month to 1 hour for delivering our platform!
      ---
      ![](img/vmware.jpg)
      ???
      * First big topic for us: we migrated our whole platform to a vmware infrastructure...
      * And we rewrote from scratch our provisioning mechanism!
      * Kinda Ops topic in which Devs participated!
      ---
      ![](img/microservices.jpg)
      ???
      * Then we rewrote from scratch the whole middleware of application!
      * Yes we love rewritting stuff!
      * This time, kinda Devs topic in which Ops participated!

      #Context's assumptions...
      ![](img/check.gif)
      ???
      * Just a bit of context: I think the *DevOps* word is overused a lot...
      * But here again it's a buzzword... So it's not that surprising...
      * I just want to say that in most situations, you're not doing DevOps... Just IT in not so good situations ;)

      #You are working with a team
      ![](img/alone.gif)
      ???
      * If you're by yourself, there's no DevOps to reach... Just loneliness to fight ;)
      ---
      #Your service actually has users
      ![](img/request.gif)
      ???
      * No users = your main target is to get users... Otherwise you're just wasting time ;)
      ---
      #BTW, you actually have a service...
      ![](img/service.gif)
      ???
      * If your service isn't in production yet, there's no DevOps!
      * You're just using big words to describe your development environment...
      ---
      #And your service is used...
      ![](img/caring.gif)
      ???
      * If nobody cares when your service is down... That probably means that nobody cares about your service at all...
      * Then DevOps isn't a target to reach: finding proper users is your main concern.
      ---
      ![](img/match.gif)
      ???
      * If you match everything: DevOps could be a target!
      * Otherwise, you probably have other concerns ;)

      #Dev &amp; Ops are different.
      ##Admit it and don't be afraid to say it.
      ???
      * Big concern nowadays: people are afraid to admit that devs and ops are different...
      * Go ahead, say it! Because they actually are!
      ---
      #Common Misconceptions

      --
      - DevOps = 50% Dev, 50% Ops!

      --
      - DevOps = 100% Generalists, 0% Specialists!

      --
      - DevOps = Devs adapting to Ops!

      --
      - DevOps = Ops adapting to Devs!

      --
      - DevOps = Must have! To be enforced in all teams!
      ---
      #Back to the Basics...

      #Developers?
      ---
      ![](img/dev.jpg)
      ???
      * Remember I talked about sarcasm?
      * From an Ops perspective... Devs are just capricious kids.
      * They want the latest version of everything, without waiting, without caring about consequences...
      * Yet, developers are:
      ---
      - Creative

      --
      - Perfectionist

      --
      - Curious

      --
      - Lazy

      --
      - Fond of new things

      --
      - Led by fashion
      ---
      #Form > Substance
      ???
      * That trap could happen if you're not taking care ;)
      * But yet again:
      ---
      #Developers can find solutions you wouldn't imagine to a problem you face.
      ---
      #Developers will challenge you towards immutable infrastructure!
      ---
      #Developers will want to automate the tests of your infrastructure provisionning!
      ---
      class: blue
      #Ops?
      ---
      ![](img/ops.jpg)
      ???
      * Look at those Ops having fun!
      * From a Dev perspective, Ops people are just sad people yelling at everybody not following their orders...
      * They're not taking risks, they're obedient without understanding...
      * But yet again, Ops people are:
      ---
      * Pragmatic

      --
      * Realistic

      --
      * Responsible

      --
      * Experienced

      --
      * Fond of stable things

      --
      * Led by efficiency
      ---
      #Substance > Form
      ???
      * Again a trap Ops people could fall into...
      * But also:
      ---
      #Ops can ask questions about issues you wouldn't imagine you may face.
      ---
      #Ops will teach you how to scale your application!
      ---
      #Ops will teach you how to increase performances!
      ---
      class: blue
      #Devs &amp; Ops have different mindsets. Deal with it.
      ???
      * That's fine: you'll get the benefits of complementarity!
      ---
      #OK. Hmm wait...
      ![](img/what.gif)
      ---
      #Want to start DevOps-ing?

      --
      - Discover your team mates!

      --
      - Listen to each others!

      --
      - Start working on complementary topics!

      --

      _Topics where you can both teach and learn something!_

      ---
      #Workshops &amp; Presentations
      ???
      * That is a must have starting point!
      * People should know each others!
      * What they like/dislike/want to do/don't want to do/think about their job/think about others job...
      * Take the required time...
      * In our case, we took 3 days to just discuss with our 8 people team!
      ---
      #Retrospective Meetings!
      ![](img/retro.png)
      ???
      * I'm talking about real retrospectives, with a nice animation!
      * Where people are searching for actions and solutions to enhance the global situation!
      * Not a place where people just yell at each others.
      * We're doing one on a monthly basis in my team.
      ---
      #Good starting point?
      ## Ask people for their main issue and how to fix it!
      _It's rarely just a tool, they'd be using it already_
      ---
      #Pair Working!
      ![](img/pair.jpg)
      ???
      * Done in a right way, it's just crazy how fast you can learn stuff!
      * In our case, we did so much Devs + Ops pair working!
      ---
      #Regular Workshops
      ![](img/workshop.png)
      ???
      * Workshops shouldn't be a one time meeting...
      * Otherwise they're easily forgotten!
      * In our team, we have a 2h Ops workshop per week,
      * And a 2h Dev workshop per week,
      * Which means a workshop dedicated to Ops tasks, and one dedicated to Dev tasks,
      * But everybody participates!
      * With some time we saw some nice situations where Devs lead the Ops workshops and the other way around!
      ---
      #Collaborative Architecture Decisions
      ![](img/archi.jpg)
      ???
      * Involve people in decisions so they'll be involved in the project!
      * Even their crazy questions/ideas can bring a lot to your decisions!
      ---
      #Be kind!
      ![](img/kind.jpg)
      ???
      * A huge clich√© but Oh God is that necessary!
      ---
      #Trust each others
      ![](img/trust.png)
      ???
      * Stop thinking Devs or Ops are dumb or don't know what they're doing!
      * They are professional and probably are doing things in a proper way...
      * Maybe they lack some information which led to them not taking the correct decisions...
      * Or maybe you lack some information and you don't undertand why they're doing things in a certain way!
      ---
      #Ask Questions
      ![](img/questions.jpg)
      ???
      * Just question everything!
      ---
      class: green
      #Methodologies?
      ---
      #Scrum probably isn't going to fit so much...
      ???
      * Forcing SCRUM is probably a really bad idea!
      * Run activities are not predictable by nature...
      * You'll lose time estimating, and then feel bad of failing your sprints!
      ---
      #You can try Kanban...
      ???
      * We did that and we're still using it.
      ---
      #Or you can have 2 different lifecycles!
      * Predictable tasks on one side,
      * Unpredictable ones on another support!
      ???
      * Care about the *predictable* and *unpredictable*.
      * It's not Devs vs Ops.
      ---
      #Anyway, keep in mind to have a balanced backlog!
      ???
      * New features, bugfixes, technical debt...
      * A bit of everything!
      ---
      class: green
      #Mandatory for DevOps: CI!
      ???
      * Aha! Mandatory CI isn't for Continuous Integration!
      * You'll probably come to Continuous Integration at some point.
      * But remember that automating silly things is just letting mistakes and errors propagate faster ;)
      ---
      #CI = Continuous Improvement!
      ???
      * You won't find the best solution on your first try!
      * You'll actually probably even never find it ;)
      * So keep trying!
      ---
      #Iterate and try out things!
      ???
      * It's important to allow yourself to fail!
      * Which is an easy to understand statement as a Dev...
      * But not so easy as an Ops!
      ---
      #Remember about the non recipe ;)
      ---
      class: green
      #What about tools?
      ---
      ![](img/evolution.png)
      ???
      * If you start from the right side, you'll never reach the left side!
      * People should understand the situation, then find a process to deal with it, and finally maybe automate things to overcome the problem.
      * At that moment, and only at that moment, they'll understand what they're doing ;)
      ---
      ![](img/monkeys.jpg)
      ???
      * See [that video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-PvBo75PDo) for reference
      * That is what could happen in a team if people are using things they don't understand...
      ---
      #Automation can be a silver bullet!

      --
      ##If you know where to aim at!
      ???
      * Cause a silver bullet in your foot remains kinda hurtful.
      ---
      #Let the team express their issues...
      ---
      #And let the team find solutions!
      ---
      #You can simply ask good questions to bring the team towards good solutions...
      ---
      #But please don't come up with off-the-shelf solutions...
      ---
      #If you're not part of the team, you probably don't know their exact problems...

      --
      ##And you'll most likely miss the target with out-of-the-box solutions.
