Hi people!

This repository contains the slides I used for a talk I gave at @worldline [TechForum](https://twitter.com/texwl) in 2018.

The goal of that talk was for me to share some feedback about a 3-4 years of DevOps experience I lived in a project. I particularly wanted to highlight that the DevOps transition we managed to do in the team was actually a human transformation and clearly relied on people learning how to efficiently share information and work together... And not just the usage of some DevOps tools or something similar.

Anyway, the slides are here. There are a few notes written if you check them out with the presenter mode *(press `p` while browsing)*. If you'd like to talk a bit more about that talk or about my DevOps experience, feel free to [contact me](https://twitter.com/antoineneveux)!
